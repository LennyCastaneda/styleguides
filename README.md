Front-end Style Guides
===========

> To me, a style guide is a living document of code, which details all the various elements and coded modules of your site or application. Beyond its use in consolidating the front-end code, it also documents the visual language, such as header styles and color palettes, used to create the site. This way, it’s a one-stop place for the entire team—from product owners and producers to designers and developers—to reference when discussing site changes and iterations. Several companies have even put their guides online; Starbucks is the most well known of the bunch, but others exist.

The intent of this repository is to collect and distribute links to front-end style guides and helpful front-end style guide resources across the web.

### What type of front-end style guides?

This repo is focused on atomic-design-style reusable patterns and components, not guidelines for code styles.
